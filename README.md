## Why Vulkan? üåå

### Unmatched Performance
Vulkan is the latest graphics API developed by the Khronos Group, providing low-level control over the GPU. This means you can squeeze out every last drop of performance from your hardware, unlocking visceral graphics and seamless gameplay experiences. With Vulkan, you get:

- Asynchronous Compute: Use your GPU's resources more efficiently by overlapping rendering and compute tasks.
- Explicit Control: Fine-tune your memory management and synchronization‚ÄîVulkan allows you to dictate how and when things render and resources are used, putting you in the driver‚Äôs seat.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility üåç
Whether you're developing for Windows, Linux, or other platforms, Vulkan‚Äôs cross-platform support makes it an ideal choice for Domkrat3D. Reach a broader audience and ensure your game runs smoothly across various devices with minimal effort.

### Advanced Rendering Techniques
Vulkan supports advanced techniques such as tessellation, volumetric lighting, and more, allowing you to create visual masterpieces without the abstraction layers obstructing your vision. Elevate your game aesthetics to professional levels! üé®

Domkrat 3D uses Vulkan version 1.4.

Major changes and additions in Vulkan 1.4:

1. added support for the Streaming Transfers mechanism, designed to enable the streaming of large amounts of data between the main system (host) and the graphics device without interrupting rendering or slowing down its performance. The mechanism is implemented using the new VK_EXT_host_image_copy extension, which is optional.;
2. performance-enhancing features have been upgraded to mandatory: Push Descriptors (the ability to write descriptor updates directly to the command buffer, instead of creating separate sets of descriptors and linking them to the command buffer), VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read (allows reading from nested buffers (attachments) and resources recorded by previous fragment shaders as part of dynamic rendering passes), VK_EXT_scalar_block_layout (allows using a C-like structure for SPIR-V blocks, in which non-scalar types can be aligned based on the size of their components);
3. The VK_KHR_maintenance5 and VK_KHR_maintenance6 extensions are included, providing auxiliary commands and structures to simplify resource and shader management.;
4. guaranteed support for rendering with a resolution of 8K (7680x4320 pixels) and using up to 8 independent rendering buffers.;
5. Many features that were previously optional have been made mandatory;
6. added a large portion of new commands and structures.
